# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! My name is John Doneth and I've been programming ever since I received my first computer. To me, programming is more than just my job, it's something I'm passionate about.

I'm a software developer from Michigan, U.S, I mainly work on building software using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

I find it a joy to take on real world problems by creating solutions though code. With the skills I've learned I can bring project ideas into reality. 
    
Feel free to checkout the public projects I've worked on at my [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnDoneth) or in my [posts](/posts).
